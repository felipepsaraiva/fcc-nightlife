# Nightlife Coordination App

Web App where you can see popular places near you and indicate where you're going. It was inspired by FreeCodeCamp's [Build a Nightlife Coordination App](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-nightlife-coordination-app) challenge and was built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS).
